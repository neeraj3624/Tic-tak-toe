# Tic-tak-toe
I’ve embarked on a new journey into web development, creating a beginner-level project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical way, enhancing my skills and deepening my understanding of web technologies.
I’ve recently embarked on an exciting journey into web development, eager to learn and develop my skills in the field. To begin, I decided to create a beginner-level project using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For this project, I focused on creating a simple yet functional web application that allowed me to practice and reinforce my understanding of the basics.

With HTML, I was able to structure the content of the webpage, ensuring proper organization of elements such as headings, paragraphs, and buttons. Using CSS, I styled the layout to make it visually appealing and responsive, making sure it looked good on various screen sizes. The real challenge came with JavaScript, where I added interactivity to the project by implementing features like form validation, dynamic content updates, and event handling.

This hands-on project has provided me with valuable practical experience, helping me bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world web development. It also allowed me to learn how to troubleshoot and solve problems, which is an essential part of the development process. As I continue to experiment and build more complex projects, I am gaining a deeper understanding of web technologies and growing more confident in my ability to create functional and interactive websites. I’m excited to keep learning and improving my skills through more practical projects in the future.
